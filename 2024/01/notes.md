# Things I did wrong
- Read problem before doing anything else
    - when copying over inputs i can think about the approach
- When researching new functions, look for a sample usage first
- When considering approaches, keep it stupid simple (KISS)
- Test smaller parts before trying to integrate within the entire program
    - Especially with external libs that take time to debug, keep scope as
      small as you can
- For syntax and inputting arguments, READ DOCUMENTATION/EXAMPLES
    - going by "feel" is going to cause a lot of error, only do this if you are
      fully confident
- SEPARATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. avoid having long, complex lines of code when
  you could easily break them into multiple smaller lines (improve readibility)
- Trace examples more carefully--just bc smth "looks" right
  doesn't mean it's actually correct
    - Examples will improve understanding of exact steps to take for algo
- Vim motions: improve efficiency with %, WORD instead of word
