# Things I did wrong
- Complexity: O(N^3)
- I overcomplicated things again
    - If I studied my input again, I would see that there are only 1000 reports
      with 4-10 (?) levels per line. Thus it would be completely fine for me to
      do a brute force solution instead of trying to "test" the fewest problematic
      levels
- I tried to do things fancy
    - I tried using functional programming style to solve this day, but it ended
      up complicating things because I needed more state than I thought
    - refactor in a smart way AFTER first solution
- Tomorrow I will look at input closer if I can accomplish with brute force
